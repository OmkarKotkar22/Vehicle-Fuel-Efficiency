## 📌 Project Overview  

The **Vehicle Fuel Efficiency** project is a **Core Java console application** that simulates how fuel efficiency of a vehicle can be calculated and displayed using object-oriented principles.  

Fuel efficiency is a crucial factor in the automotive industry, used to measure how far a vehicle can travel per unit of fuel. This project captures that real-life concept by defining a `Vehicle` model and a main execution class that processes and displays efficiency details.  

The project is intentionally designed to be **simple yet realistic**, helping beginners understand how Java classes interact in a real-world inspired scenario.

## 🎯 Real-Life Context  

Fuel efficiency calculations are widely used in:  

- Automobile manufacturing companies  
- Vehicle comparison platforms  
- Government fuel rating systems  
- Fleet management software  

**Real-life example:**  
Car manufacturers like **Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, and Hyundai** publish mileage data calculated using fuel efficiency formulas similar to what this project demonstrates at a basic level.

📝 Class Responsibilities
---
🔹 Vehicle.java (Model Class)  
Represents a vehicle entity  
Stores data related to fuel and distance  
Contains logic or data needed for efficiency calculation  

Industry Mapping:  
Similar to vehicle data objects used in automotive software systems.  

🔹 Vehicle_Efficiency.java (Main Class)  
Entry point of the application  
Creates Vehicle objects  
Calculates and displays fuel efficiency  
Controls program execution flow  

Industry Mapping:  
Comparable to service or controller classes in real systems.  

🖥️ Sample Output (Console)
